# Multiclass Classifier

This repository contains solutions to exercises on implementing a multiclass classifier for the MNIST dataset using PyTorch.

## Files

1. **`layered_model.py`**: Contains functions to define dense models, train the models for multiclass classification, and evaluate their performance.

## Exercise Details

### Overview

In this exercise, you will implement a multiclass classifier using concepts learned from previous exercises. The objectives include enhancing your understanding of multiclass classification, reusing and modifying solutions from Exercise 4, and implementing/train a multiclass classifier model.

### Functions to Implement

1. **`define_dense_model_single_layer`**: Define a dense model with a single layer.
2. **`define_dense_model_with_hidden_layer`**: Define a dense model with a hidden layer.
3. **`fit_mnist_model`**: Train the model for multiclass classification.
4. **`evaluate_mnist_model`**: Evaluate the performance of the trained multiclass classifier.
